Just school projects which I have all put into a single program with a launcher, ignore the fucked up code if you are here viewing for whatever reason other than grading this thing, if you ARE here to grade me, the code is in a different file, the file Program.cs is the launcher, Then any other assigments or whatever is in a separated file named by the assigment or by the general thing it is supposed to do. (e.g. Hello world and other basic stuff will be in HelloWorld.cs)
